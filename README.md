I am interested in news and music. So I have developed two Linux Bash scripts for downloading latest international radio news and playing them together with songs from mp3 music playlists.

InfRadio is a script that goes on playing music and up-to-date news indefinitely: https://github.com/EloHope/infRadio.

With FunkRadio you can select individual news broadcasts for listening alongside  your favorite songs: https://github.com/EloHope/funkRadio.

A script to make playlists on the basis of directories, album or artist names, or song duration: https://github.com/EloHope/make_playlist/tree/main.

EloHope/EloHope is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
