I am interested in news and music. So I have developed two Linux bash scripts for downloading the latest internatonal radio news and playing them together with songs from mp3 music playlists.

InfRadio is a script that goes on playing music and up-to-date news indefinitely. 

With FunkRadio you can select individual news broadcasts for listening alongside  your favorite songs.
