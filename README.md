I am interested in news and music. So I have developed two scripts for downloading radio news and
playing them alternating with my favorite music.

InfRadio is a script that goes on playing music and up-to-date news indefinitely. 

FunkRadio is a linux bash script that gives you the latest international news broadcasts 
and entertains with your favorite songs. Start by going to 
https://github.com/EloHope/funkradio.start.here/blob/main/Overview.md

I also include detailed instructions on how to install Arch Linux - in Finnish and in English
(translated from Finnish by Google Translator I am afraid).
